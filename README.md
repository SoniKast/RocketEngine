# Rocket Engine
A Sonic Advance-styled Sonic Engine for GameMaker: Studio.

_________________________________________________________
Features:
- Mostly Advance 1-accurate physics.
- 5 playable characters: Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Amy and Shadow.
- All characters have their respective attacks and maneuvers.
- By getting the 7 Chaos Emeralds, you can play as Super Sonic.
- Background parallax system.
- Palette cycling system, usable on backgrounds and sprites.
- Simple to understand: Based on Harinezumi, which is based on previous GameMaker Sonic engines, so the structure of the engine is the same.
- Good base for advance style games.

Bugs / Glitches that I'm aware of:
- The result screen tile/background warping, it's minor but I know it's noticeable. It can be fixed but I'm not entirely sure of how and it's just a test level so I'm sure if one were to use it normally, they could figure out a solution to make it work better.
- The physics / some of the attacks may not be entirely accurate, but I'm still not a GameMaker expert, so please excuse me.
- Grinding isn't the most functional...
